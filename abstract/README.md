1. Abstract class provided you power to simply declare a method and not implement it
2. These methods which are declared in Abstract classes are implemented in Subclasses that will extend abstract class
3. We cannot create instance of abstract classes
4. A class can be defined abstract by using abstract keyword
5. If a concrete class extends an abstract class , it will have to provide implementation for all abstract methods
6. Abstract class can extend another abstract class
7. If abstract class is extending another abstract class it can have unimplemented method
8. We can have non-abstract methods in abstract class

Difference between Abstract and Interface

1. Benefit using interface is that you can create instance of interface class and make use of methods that are used by
   two diff class which have implemented interface

Interface

1. A Interface can extend other interface
2. Class implementing the interface which is extending other interface, will have to implement methods in both the
   interfaces
3. Interface allows you to access common methods between the class implementing the interface
4.
